# Winter School Notebooks
This repository contains the notebooks used for the exercises at the DMSC Winter School. Its a condensed version of the [DMSC Summer School](https://ess-dmsc-dram.github.io/dmsc-school/intro.html), so only the 3-mcstas and 4-reduction folders will be used, though the rest of the material is available in the repository.

## Getting started
Clone this repository to your VISA instance and open the desired notebook. You will be asked which kernel to use, choose "ESS", it has all the software we need installed.

## Exercises
There are three available exercise tracks:

- SANS
- QENS
- Powder diffraction

You will use McStas through Python to generate your data set, which you will then continue to work with in the later reduction exercises. There will be a backup dataset available in case you don't get through the entire McStas exercise notebook.

### Short versions of notebooks
Due to the shorter avialble time for exercises, the McStas notebooks are available in shortened versions that remove the most time consuming questions. Choose this version of the notebooks unless you already have a bit of McStasScript experience.

### Solutions
Solutions can be found in the book [https://ess-dmsc-dram.github.io/winter-school/intro.html](https://ess-dmsc-dram.github.io/winter-school/intro.html)
